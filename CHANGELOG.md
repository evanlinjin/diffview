# Changelog

All notable changes to dv. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org); a release's notes
on GitHub are its section here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `Space g`: show only what isn't committed (to check Claude's changes), commit it (the
  message starts from Claude's "Changed: …" replies since the last commit), and push to the
  branch it tracks (a PR's, under its own name). The review loop no longer leaves dv.
- dv keeps an installed dv-review skill up to date with itself, and a PR's Claude session
  that started with another version of the skill isn't resumed (Claude Code reads a skill
  once per session). `Space a` can start a fresh session for the PR.
- `S` lists what's still open under its choices: Claude's open comments (and how many it
  answered, waiting for you), unresolved GitHub threads, pending comments on code that has
  changed since, a checkout that isn't the PR's head. Approving puts them in the editor too, as
  hint lines (not posted).
- Claude's comments show whose turn it is: `[waiting]` (you spoke last) and `[answered]`
  (Claude answered you); typing either in `Space A` lists just those.
- A `severity` for Claude's comments (`bug`, `nit`, `question`, …), shown as a tag and put
  before the text when you copy the comment to GitHub.
- "Update Claude's review" after new commits on top of the one it reviewed asks it to review
  just those (`git diff <its head>`).
- On someone else's PR, "make the changes" becomes "suggest the changes": GitHub suggestion
  blocks in Claude's comments for you to post, and no edits to the code.
- Untracked files show in the diff (marked untracked), and changing one reloads it.
- `dv list`: `D D` in the worktrees tab removes the PR's worktree (not with local changes in
  it; its branch stays); up to 1000 PRs (was 200), and Enter on a `#N` filter opens PR N even
  if it isn't listed.

### Fixed
- `C` beside a pending review says so up front: GitHub refuses single comments then.
- A refused review submission (e.g. approving your own PR) no longer leaves an empty pending
  review behind.
- GitHub's reasons for refusing something show in full, before where your text was saved.
- Claude finds `dv` (this one) when dv was started by its path or the Claude pane gets a
  different PATH (a zellij pane gets zellij's environment), so it can run `dv review-*`.
- Claude's reply times are right: the prompt tells it the time.
- dv no longer rewrites the review file to give comments ids while Claude may be editing it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added
- dv reloads the diff when the working tree changes under it (Claude making changes, a save in
  hx, anything else), about once a second, keeping the cursor where it is; and right after a
  background Claude run.
- Mouse support: the wheel scrolls (the view, a popup, a picker's selection), a click moves
  the cursor there (code, comment margin, either split side) or folds on a fold arrow, a drag
  selects; in pickers and `dv list` a click picks and a second click opens. `--no-mouse` leaves
  the mouse to the terminal (most terminals select text with Shift held either way).
- `Space u` updates the checkout: to the PR's head (fast-forward only, keeping local commits),
  or `git pull --ff-only` without a PR, then refreshes.
- Comments in the right margin: in single-pane view on a wide window (room for 80 columns of
  code beside the margin: a third of the window, 60–80 columns, or all beyond 200 columns of
  code side; thread tags on a line of their
  own under the header), review threads sit beside their lines instead of between
  them. A box that would overlap the one before goes just below it; code only gets blank
  rows where a file's comments need more room than its code. `Ctrl-w l` / `Ctrl-w h` move
  between code and comments; the box about the cursor's line (or the line a box is about) is
  lit. `Ctrl-w c` switches to inline comments and back.
- In the same layout, the PR's conversation (and Claude's summary) sits beside the
  description: whole comments, while there's description beside them; the rest follows full
  width below.
- One Claude Code session per PR, kept next to its review file: every run (background or in a
  pane, from any dv and any worktree) continues the same conversation about that PR.
- Claude's notes on the repo (`notes.md` in dv's directory, shared by worktrees): the skill reads them
  before each task and keeps them up to date (conventions, subtle code, your review
  preferences), so what it learns carries over to the next PR. `Space a` opens them in hx.
- Approving a PR (`S`, Approve) starts the summary as `ACK <the PR's head commit>`.
- `a` on code lines leaves Claude a comment there (a question or a request), in the review file;
  Claude answers right away, and `r` continues the thread. Nothing goes to GitHub.
- "Ask Claude to make the changes" acts on the review's open comments, Claude's and the ones
  you left it, and works with none too: then what you write is the request ("Ask Claude to
  make a change"). It's checked whether Claude can take it before the editor opens, and if
  it still can't, what you wrote is saved to a file.
- Background Claude runs may run `cargo check`, `cargo build`, `cargo test` and `cargo clippy`,
  to check a change they made.
- `Space a` → "Dismiss Claude's outdated comments": all of Claude's comments whose code has
  changed, after a confirmation (your own comments for Claude stay).
- `]p` / `[p` step through your pending review's comments (replies too), wrapping around.
- `Ctrl-d` in the pending comments picker (`Space p`) deletes the selected comment (after a
  confirmation); the review thread key popup lists `Space d`.

### Changed
- dv's files for a repo (Claude's reviews, sessions, notes) move from `.git/dv` to
  `~/.local/share/dv/<repo>/` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME`), on first use: Claude Code refuses to edit
  anything inside `.git`, so background Claude runs couldn't write the review there. Claude
  runs get access to that directory (`--add-dir`), from worktrees too.
- When a Claude run is refused something, dv says what (in the status bar, and keeps one log
  per run) instead of "done"; replies made meanwhile wait rather than hit the same refusal.
- Approving pre-fills `ACK <PR head>` even when your checkout has diverged from it, with a hint
  above it (not posted) that it isn't what you have checked out.
- Inside zellij, `Enter` reuses dv's hx pane while it's open (`:open` + `:goto` there) instead of
  opening another, and dv reloads as you save in it, not only when hx exits.
- Claude resolves a thread once it's settled (it made the change asked for, or you agree it
  doesn't apply), after replying; answering a question leaves it open. Reopen with `Space r`.
- Inside zellij, a PR's Claude Code pane is reused: when it's open, `Space a` puts the request
  in its input (pasted, focused; you press Enter) instead of opening another pane, and leaves
  it alone while it's asking you something. Replies are answered in the background on a fork
  of its session, so nothing is typed into a pane behind your back.
- Claude Code sessions are kept per checkout directory (as Claude Code stores them), and one it
  doesn't have isn't resumed.
- Inside zellij, hx, the comment editor and Claude Code open in a pane to the right instead of
  a floating one.

### Fixed
- dv no longer freezes while hx is open beside it: hx runs in its own pane and dv reloads when
  it exits.
- `dv N` for a PR that has a `<repo>-N` worktree opens it there (its branch couldn't be checked
  out in the main checkout too).
- A PR branch with local commits that aren't on the PR (unpushed work, a local rebase) opens
  as it is, with a note, instead of failing to fast-forward; `-f` still resets it to the PR.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-16

The first release.

### Diff
- base → working tree diff, unified or side by side (`Ctrl-w v`), syntax highlighted, changed
  words emphasised, context expandable per hunk (`+` / `-`, `Z` for the whole file).
- Helix-style cursor and selections, motions (`w b e`, `f t`, `gw`, `mm`, …), search, jump
  list; your Helix theme, `cursorline`, `line-number` and `jump-label-alphabet`.
- rust-analyzer: go to definition / references / type / implementations, hover.
- Open `hx` at the cursor (in a floating pane inside zellij); copy text, patches, `path:line`
  refs and comment links.

### GitHub
- `dv N` checks out PR N (`-w` in a worktree next to the repo, `-b` on its branch, `--rm` to
  remove it). `dv list`: the open PRs as cards with CI, review state, size and labels, sorted
  and filtered GitHub-search style, plus a tab of the PRs you have worktrees for.
- The PR's description, conversation, checks and review threads inline, rendered like
  github.com, in boxes; outdated threads relocated to their code.
- Comment on selected lines, suggest changes, reply, edit, delete, resolve, quote into the
  conversation; a pending review you submit with `S`; mark files viewed.
- Issue / PR link previews (`Space k`).

### Claude Code
- `dv install-skill` installs the `dv-review` skill: Claude Code writes a review that dv shows
  inline (`dv review-info`, `dv review-check`), anchored to its code as the code changes.
- Reply to Claude from dv and it answers right away; ask it to review or to make the changes
  its open comments ask for (`Space a`, with your own instructions if you like); copy its
  comments into your GitHub review.

### Keys
- Which-key popups after prefix keys, and the keys for what's under the cursor in the same
  corner; `?` lists every key (two columns on wide windows, `/` to search).
