# Changelog

All notable changes to dv. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org); a release's notes
on GitHub are its section here.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Inside zellij, hx, the comment editor and Claude Code open in a pane to the right instead of
  a floating one.

### Fixed
- dv no longer freezes while hx is open beside it: hx runs in its own pane and dv reloads when
  it exits.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-16

The first release.

### Diff
- base → working tree diff, unified or side by side (`Ctrl-w v`), syntax highlighted, changed
  words emphasised, context expandable per hunk (`+` / `-`, `Z` for the whole file).
- Helix-style cursor and selections, motions (`w b e`, `f t`, `gw`, `mm`, …), search, jump
  list; your Helix theme, `cursorline`, `line-number` and `jump-label-alphabet`.
- rust-analyzer: go to definition / references / type / implementations, hover.
- Open `hx` at the cursor (in a floating pane inside zellij); copy text, patches, `path:line`
  refs and comment links.

### GitHub
- `dv N` checks out PR N (`-w` in a worktree next to the repo, `-b` on its branch, `--rm` to
  remove it). `dv list`: the open PRs as cards with CI, review state, size and labels, sorted
  and filtered GitHub-search style, plus a tab of the PRs you have worktrees for.
- The PR's description, conversation, checks and review threads inline, rendered like
  github.com, in boxes; outdated threads relocated to their code.
- Comment on selected lines, suggest changes, reply, edit, delete, resolve, quote into the
  conversation; a pending review you submit with `S`; mark files viewed.
- Issue / PR link previews (`Space k`).

### Claude Code
- `dv install-skill` installs the `dv-review` skill: Claude Code writes a review that dv shows
  inline (`dv review-info`, `dv review-check`), anchored to its code as the code changes.
- Reply to Claude from dv and it answers right away; ask it to review or to make the changes
  its open comments ask for (`Space a`, with your own instructions if you like); copy its
  comments into your GitHub review.

### Keys
- Which-key popups after prefix keys, and the keys for what's under the cursor in the same
  corner; `?` lists every key (two columns on wide windows, `/` to search).
